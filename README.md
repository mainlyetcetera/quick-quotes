## About The Project

![home-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70294115/110416690-5e6f7080-8051-11eb-8436-7d66618990e6.png)

You're in a discussion with friends. And someone says: "I need a good quote on this topic for inspiration!"
And here YOU COME to the rescue! Pull out `QuickQuotes`, select a category, and get a relevant quote instantly!

That's `QuickQuotes`, your one-stop shop for quotes on almost any relevant topic! But just because it's fast doesn't mean it's not versatile! You can `favorite` any quote you come across for later refernce, so no worries about losing your next favorite quote! 

This project is the final project for [Turing School of Software and Design's](https://turing.io/) Frontend Mod 3. For this project we were challenged to not only use React to build an entire app with the help of an outside API, but we needed to make the app for a specific [niche audience](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html). The audience I chose was: a person who wants to quickly access a quote in a conversation AND be able to reference it later!

## Learning Goals
- use React hooks to set up and maintain state
- include thorough `Cypress` end-to-end testing
- employ `React Router`, which evolved into `Hash Router` to allow for multiple routes and urls
- deploy the app on GitHub Pages
- successfully use asynchronous JavaScript with the use of `async/await`, including error handling
- create user personas and be driven by user stories
- design my own MVP
